# Market Analysis App
Code 201 Project

This app displays 3 unique products to the user and asks them to choose the product they are most likely to purchase. After each click 3 unique products will appear and they can vote again. Each user can vote 15 times. After 15 votes a button will appear for them to view the results. Once they click the button to view results a reset button will appear and if clicked will reset all votes back to zero and they can vote again.

### N13  -
+ Created a constructer for products and an object literal to handle the functionality of the app.
+ Used if...else... statement to ensure images are unique.
+ Used if statement inside of a for loop to check that user clicked on an image and not outside.
+ Used an event listener to handle votes for each image and totalClicks.
